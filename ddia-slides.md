# Designing Data-Intensive Applications
## A Guide for ML & Data Science Systems

---

# 1. Foundation Concepts

## Data-Intensive vs. Compute-Intensive
- **Data-Intensive**: Quantity, complexity, and speed of data are primary challenges
- **ML Systems**: Often both data and compute-intensive
- **Key Challenges**: Storage, retrieval, processing at scale

## Reliability in ML Systems
- Model serving must be reliable
- Training pipeline reliability
- Data pipeline dependability
- **Example**: Netflix recommendation system
  - Must handle failed nodes
  - Graceful degradation to simpler models
  - Data consistency across training/serving

# 2. Data Models & Storage

## Considerations for ML Data
- **Structured Data**: Traditional databases
- **Unstructured Data**: Document stores
- **Semi-structured**: Graph databases
- **Feature Stores**: Specialized ML data storage

### When to Choose What
- **Relational DB**: Clean, structured training data
- **Document Store**: Varied data formats, flexible schema
- **Graph DB**: Connected data, complex relationships
- **Vector DB**: Similarity search, embeddings storage

# 3. Scale Considerations

## Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling
- **Vertical**: Bigger machines
- **Horizontal**: More machines

### ML-Specific Scaling
- Model parallelism
- Data parallelism
- Batch vs. Real-time inference

## Over-Engineering Warning Signs
1. Premature distributed training
2. Unnecessary real-time processing
3. Over-complex data pipelines

---

# 4. Maintainability

## Key Aspects
- **Operability**: Easy to operate
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand
- **Evolvability**: Easy to modify

## ML-Specific Maintenance
- Model versioning
- Data versioning
- Feature store management
- Experiment tracking

### Anti-Patterns
- Too many model variants
- Unclear data lineage
- Unmonitored drift

# 5. When to Scale: Decision Framework

## Questions to Ask
1. Current performance metrics?
2. Expected growth rate?
3. Cost of downtime?
4. Data velocity requirements?

## Scale Triggers for ML Systems
- Training time > acceptable window
- Inference latency > SLA
- Data processing bottlenecks
- Resource utilization > 70%

# 6. Reliability Considerations

## Key Metrics
- Model performance stability
- System uptime
- Data pipeline reliability
- Inference latency

## When to Invest in Reliability
### High Priority
- Customer-facing ML services
- Critical decision systems
- Real-time recommendations

### Lower Priority
- Experimental models
- Internal analysis tools
- Batch predictions

---

# 7. Case Studies

## Example 1: Recommendation System
### Over-Engineered
- Real-time processing for daily updates
- Distributed training for small datasets
- Complex A/B testing infrastructure

### Right-Sized
- Batch processing
- Single-machine training
- Simple champion/challenger testing

## Example 2: Fraud Detection
### Appropriate Complexity
- Real-time processing needed
- Distributed training justified
- Complex monitoring required

# 8. Best Practices

## System Design
1. Start simple, scale with evidence
2. Monitor before optimizing
3. Choose boring technology
4. Automate repetitive tasks

## ML-Specific
1. Version everything
2. Make experiments reproducible
3. Monitor data and model drift
4. Plan for model updates
