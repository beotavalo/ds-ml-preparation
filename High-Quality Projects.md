# Python Development Practices for High-Quality Projects

This guide outlines essential practices for enhancing the quality, maintainability, and efficiency of Python projects.

## Dependency Management
- **Use `pyproject.toml` Instead of `requirements.txt`**  
  Manage dependencies with `pyproject.toml` for increased flexibility and to avoid additional files like `dev-requirements.txt`.

- **Adopt a Version and Project Manager**  
  Tools like **Poetry** or **UV** simplify:
  - Dependency management.
  - Virtual environment creation.
  - Running applications in isolated environments.

## Code Quality and Readability
- **Incorporate Type Hints**  
  Use type hints to:
  - Improve code readability.
  - Enable static analysis tools like `ruff` and `mypy` to detect potential errors.
  - Simplify long-term code maintenance by making function parameters and return types explicit.

- **Add a "Raises" Section to Docstrings**  
  Document all possible exceptions a function may raise in the **Raises** section of its docstring. This:
  - Helps developers anticipate potential issues.
  - Simplifies code debugging and maintenance.

- **Use Pydantic Models for Data Handling**  
  Replace dictionaries and numerous function parameters with **Pydantic models** to:
  - Validate data types.
  - Handle errors efficiently.
  - Simplify data passing between functions.

## Code Analysis and Formatting
- **Implement a Linter and Formatter**  
  Use tools like **Ruff** for:
  - Enforcing `Black` formatting standards.
  - Detecting common code issues.
  - Configuring additional rules in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistent code quality.

## Testing Practices
- **Use Pytest Instead of Unittest**  
  **Pytest** offers:
  - A concise and flexible syntax.
  - Advanced testing features, including fixtures.

## Additional Suggestions (Hot Takes)
These practices may not suit every project but are worth considering:
- **Use `orjson` Instead of `json`**  
  Gain better performance for JSON serialization and deserialization.
  
- **Prefer f-Strings Over String Concatenation**  
  Simplify string formatting with the cleaner and faster syntax of f-strings.

- **Leverage `pathlib` Instead of `os.path`**  
  Modernize file and directory manipulation with the more intuitive `pathlib` module.

- **Use `click` Instead of `argparse` or `sys.argv`**  
  Simplify CLI creation with `click`'s declarative syntax and robust features.

- **Upgrade to Python 3.8+**  
  Take advantage of newer Python features, such as:
  - Assignment expressions (walrus operator `:=`).
  - Positional-only parameters.
  - Improved typing and performance enhancements.

## Conclusion
These best practices will help you maintain a high-quality standard for your Python projects, improve collaboration, and future-proof your codebase.
